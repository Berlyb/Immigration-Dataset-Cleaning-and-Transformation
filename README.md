# Immigration-Dataset-Cleaning-and-Transformation

*Overview*

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming a large immigration dataset to analyze its influence on coffee sales across various regions. The insights from this step will feed into a predictive model for coffee sales, enabling a deeper understanding of how immigration patterns impact market demand.

The primary operations include converting the dataset from CSV format to Parquet for efficient processing, exploring its structure, and preparing it for integration into the coffee sales predictive modeling pipeline.

*Features*

Data Preparation for Predictive Modeling: Cleans and prepares the immigration dataset for use in building a predictive model for coffee sales.
Data Format Conversion: Converts large CSV files to Parquet format for faster read/write operations and reduced storage space.
Data Exploration: Analyzes the dataset's structure, including unique values for geographical regions and demographic factors that could correlate with coffee sales.
Scalability: Utilizes PyArrow to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring compatibility with modern data processing workflows.

*Project Workflow*

Load Dataset: Load the immigration dataset from a CSV file.
Convert to Parquet: Save the dataset as a Parquet file with Snappy compression for efficient storage and processing.
Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand key attributes such as geographical regions and demographic factors.
Prepare for Predictive Model: Ensure the dataset is structured and cleaned for integration into the coffee sales prediction pipeline.

*Context and Objective*

This project is part of a larger effort to build a predictive model for coffee sales in Canada. By analyzing immigration patterns and their potential impact on consumer behavior, this preparatory step helps identify key factors influencing coffee demand. Insights gained from this analysis will serve as inputs for the predictive model, improving its accuracy and relevance to market conditions.

*Outputs*

Parquet file: A compressed and optimized version of the original dataset.
Insights: Preliminary analysis of immigration factors that could influence coffee sales.
